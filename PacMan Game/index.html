			<h2>The classic and enormously popular Pac-Man video game came out in Japan on May 21, 1980, <br>
				and by October of that year it was released in the United States. <br>
				The yellow, pie-shaped Pac-Man character, who travels around a maze trying to eat dots and avoid four
				hunting ghosts, <br>
				quickly became an icon of the 1980s.</h2>
